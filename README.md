# Build-RNN-with-TensorFlow-v2
This repository includes some examples which build RNNs with TensorFlow v2

The "RNN on aclImdb.py" is an implementaion of a many-to-many RNN for an application of language modeling. The example is purposefully simple to introduce the main concepts of RNNs.
A compressed archive for the movie review dataset (84.1 MB) can be downloaded from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ as a gzip-compressed tarball archive. 
You can directly unpack the gzip-compressed tarball archive directly in python with "Extract gz.py file".
